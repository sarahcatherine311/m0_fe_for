# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?
    Pretty shaky understanding when you start combining it with  other things, but by itself it makes sense.
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
    Productive and unproductive struggle was real. Productive struggle came with working with fellow students to problem solve. Unproductive struggle was trying to research and google by myself and reading endless articles that brought no further understanding of the topic.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
    I need to practice some more of these challenges. I will have to write some of my own up and see if I can do them in my personal time.
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
    None, but I would ask fellow classmates or other devs.
